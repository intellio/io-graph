A call that does not receive this request within 45 minutes is considered inactive and will subsequently end.

Make sure that these requests are successful to prevent the call from timing out and ending. Attempting to send a request to a call that has already ended will result in a 404 Not-Found error. The resources related to the call should be cleaned up on the application side.
